### This is a header
I've grown tired of blogging on Wordpress. It has become:

- bloated
- slow
- ugly
- messy

I'm trying to migrate to a much leaner, static markdown-based blog and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) seems nice.This was sparked by a comment I found on Twitter:

> Don't use Wordpress. Be cool.

And so here I am.

### A second section
Here's some interesting code:

```python
# prints to standard out
print "hello world"
```

w00t **markdown**! :)
