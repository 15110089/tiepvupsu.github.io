%
% Change History:
%
% 1.2.2: * Added some information to the main driver file (this
%          file) regarding the use of hyperref with the
%          psuthesis class. Thanks to Nathan Urban for pointing
%          out the included workaround.
%
% 1.2.1: * Finally reproduced and fixed the problem where the
%          page number listed in the TOC for the Bibliography
%          was the last page number of the Bibliography.
%
%        * Added 10pt and 11pt options to the document class,
%          though we have no idea why anyone would want to use
%          such insanely small font sizes since it will lead to
%          line lengths that are much too long.
%
% 1.2.0: * Two additional class options have been added to
%          support honors theses submitted to the Schreyer
%          Honors College. These options are:
%             - honors
%             - honorsdepthead
%          See below for details.
%
%        * We have also added the commands:
%             - honorsdegreeinfo
%             - honorsadviser
%             - honorsdepthead
%          Again, see below for details.
%
% 1.1.2: * If you want to use the subfigure package with our
%          psuthesis class file, then you must must find the
%          following line in the psuthesis.cls file:
%
%          \RequirePackage{tocloft}
%
%          and add the subfigure option. We have already set
%          this up for you in the psuthesis.cls file to make
%          this easy to do.
%
% 1.1.1: * Added the fncychap package to the distribution.
%
% 1.1.0: * The way that the thesis frontmatter and backmatter
%          is generated has been completely re-done in order
%          to be more intuitive.
%        * We have added the ability to change the title of
%          the Dedication/Epigraph to anything you please.
%        * In the process of changing the format of the Table
%          of Contents to conform to the inflexible rules of
%          the Grad School (the word ``Chapter'' and
%          ``Appendix'' need to appear before the number and
%          letter, respectively), we have added an option to
%          the class called inlinechaptertoc that changes the
%          format of the Chapter/Appendix entries in the TOC.
%          Note that the tocloft package is now required.
%        * Appendices should now start with the
%          \Appendix command rather than \chapter. See the
%          accompanying files for examples.
%        * Added information regarding the Nontechnical
%          Abstract that is required of ESM students.
%        * Added the fncychap package for those of you who like
%          the nice Chapter headings it provides. We like
%          Lenny, but you don't have to use it if you don't
%          want to. In addition, the other options are: Sonny,
%          Glenn, Conny, Rejne, and Bjarne
%
% 1.0.4: * fixed the \addcontentsline entry for BibTeX within
%          the commented out text in the Bibliography section
%
% 1.0.3: * added a sigpage option to conform to new Grad School
%          requirements
%
% 1.0.2: * issued the \appendix command to start the appendices
%        * moved the \addcontentsline for the bibliography so
%          that the bibliography now shows up on the right page
%          in the TOC
%        * added some info if you use bibtex
%
% 1.0.1: * eqlist and eqparbox are now included in the archive
%

%
% This is a template file to help get you started using the
% psuthesis.cls for theses and dissertations at Penn State
% University. You will, of course, need to put the
% psuthesis.cls file someplace that LaTeX will find it.
%
% We have set up a directory structure that we find to be clean
% and convenient. You can readjust it to suit your tastes. In
% fact, the structure used by our students is even a little
% more involved and commands are defined to point to the
% various directories.
%
% This document has been set up to be typeset using pdflatex.
% About the only thing you will need to change if typesetting
% using latex is the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions command.
%
% The psuthesis document class uses the same options as the
% book class. In addition, it requires that you have the
% ifthen, calc, setspace, and tocloft packages.
%
% The first additional option specifies the degree type. You
% can choose from:
%     Ph.D. using class option <phd>
%     M.S. using class option <ms>
%     M.Eng. using class option <meng>
%     M.A. using class option <ma>
%     B.S. using class option <bs>
%     B.A. using class option <ba>
%     Honors Baccalaureate using the option <honors>
%
% If you specify either ba or bs in addition to honors, it will
% just use the honors option and ignore the ba or bs option.
%
% The second additional option <inlinechaptertoc> determines
% the formatting of the Chapter entries in the Table of
% Contents. The default sets them as two-line entries (try it).
% If you want them as one-line entries, issue the
% inlinechaptertoc option.
%
% The class option ``honors'' should be used for theses
% submitted to the Schreyer Honors College. This option
% changes the formatting on the Title page so that the
% signatures appear on the Title page. Be sure and comment
% out the command \psusigpage when using this option since it
% is not needed and it messes up the vertical spacing on the
% Title page.
%
% The class option ``honorsdepthead'' adds the signature of the
% department head on the Title page for those baccalaureate
% theses that require this.
%
% The class option ``secondthesissupervisor'' should be used
% for baccalaureate honors degrees if you have a second
% Thesis Supervisor.
%
% The vita is only included with the phd option and it is
% placed at the end of the thesis. The permissions page is only
% included with the ms, meng, and ma options.

% Quay lại [ví dụ đơn giản được nêu trong bài trước]%(/2016/12/27/categories/#regression): một căn nhà rộng $x_1 ~ \text{m}^2$, có $x_2$ phòng ngủ và cách trung tâm thành phố $x_3~ \text{km}$ có giá là bao nhiêu. Giả sử chúng ta đã có số liệu thống kê từ 1000 căn nhà trong thành phố đó, liệu rằng khi có một căn nhà mới với các thông số về diện tích, số phòng ngủ và khoảng cách tới trung tâm, chúng ta có thể dự đoán được giá của căn nhà đó không? Nếu có thì hàm dự đoán $y = f(\mathbf{x}) $ sẽ có dạng như thế nào. Ở đây $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3] $ là một vector hàng chứa thông tin _input_, $y$ là một số vô hướng (scalar) biểu diễn _output_ (tức giá của căn nhà trong ví dụ này).

% \textbf{Lưu ý về ký hiệu toán học:} \textit{trong các bài viết của tôi, các số vô hướng được biểu diễn bởi các chữ cái viết ở dạng không in đậm, có thể viết hoa, ví dụ $x_1, N, y, k$. Các vector được biểu diễn bằng các chữ cái thường in đậm, ví dụ $\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x}_1 $. Các ma trận được biểu diễn bởi các chữ viết hoa in đậm, ví dụ $\mathbf{X, Y, W} $.}

% Một cách đơn giản nhất, chúng ta có thể thấy rằng: i) diện tích nhà càng lớn thì giá nhà càng cao; ii) số lượng phòng ngủ càng lớn thì giá nhà càng cao; iii) càng xa trung tâm thì giá nhà càng giảm. Một hàm số đơn giản nhất có thể mô tả mối quan hệ giữa giá nhà và 3 đại lượng đầu vào là:
